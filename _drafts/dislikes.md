Posts I don't like:

* Impractical
  * Waxing philosophical without any grounding or immediate actions to take from it.
  I suppose they are not always bad, but I think if that is the goal from the start, it
  ends up sounding pretentious.
* Magpie
   *  I found this new thing that I've been using for 10 minutes that I am excited about
   and now the whole world should change and use it because it is the One Truth.
   * Although I do appreciate a good new product run-down, and there's nothing wrong
   with getting excited about a new tool.  There is something wrong with getting on
   a high horse.
* Pretense
  * Assuming that everyone agrees with you
  * Assuming the author knows best
* Condescension
  * Phrases like "simply", "easy", "basic" - in a lot of contexts this belittles the reader, especially
  if it is an unfamiliar subject area
  * Denigrating platforms or entire categories of people - things are never that simple
* Sweeping statements
* Overly prescriptive
  * If only everyone adopted my point of view/this new technology the world would be better
* Absolutes
 * I always ..., We should never ..., The only way ...
