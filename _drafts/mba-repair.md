title:  "Replacing a Macbook Air Top Case After a Spill"

Story time.  About 2 years ago, I spilled beer all over my laptop (a mid 2011 Macbook Air 13").

Foolishly, I did not power it down, and soon after, the keyboard starting acting funny.  The keys in the bottom left all acted together.  If I pushed one, they all went down. If I pushed the control key on the right side, the left function key counted as pressed and stayed down.  Some of the function keys were not responsive.  Pressing some of the keys felt a little crunchy too.

I put the laptop on life support. And by that I mean I stuck it in a drawer and plugged in an external keyboard and monitor.  I even got a KVM switch so I could switch between my laptop and my desktop. Those are pretty cool if you haven't checked them out.  I bought this one [link]



Anyway, times changed, my setup didn't make sense anymore, and my laptop was gathering dust.

After re-examining everything I owned during a recent move, I dedided I needed to either get this thing working or get rid of it.  I looked into selling it, and the price for selling it for parts was pretty low on ebay.  I was also hesitant to sell anything online for fear of how much work it would require. (Since then, I've become a craigslist addict.)

I had heard of iFixit before and thought the toolkits they sold were super cool.  Whenever my phone's screen broke, or my laptop's harddrive crashed, I felt tempted to buy the toolkit and the part, but by that time, it would be too expensive.  This time, I decided since this was a full on hobby project anyway, I may as well get the toolkit.  Then in the future if I need to repair something I will already have the tools.

I looked for a repair guide for a macbook air laptop.  I briefly considered buying
just the small number of tools needed for the repair, but the latest tool kit sold me
with its case and all that jazz.  The teardown I used was here [link]

I next needed to buy my replacement part.  I bought a top case from PowerBookMedic.

I have since learned that you can buy just a replacement keyboard which is likely all I needed.  This is significantly cheaper, so I would recommend going that route if you find yourself in a similar situation.

When buying from PowerBookMedic, I recommend using their serial number compatibility checker.  I did not do this, and I ended up ordering a Macbook Air 11" instead of a 13", d'oh!  I actually did not realize my mistake until I had completely disassembled my computer and was ready to pop in the replacement.  So I also recommend you check your part before starting on your repair!

 I talked to one of my friends who is an electrical engineer and he suggested that I may not need a replacement at all.  Since the keyboard is mostly mechanical, and everything else in my computer was working fine, that I may just need to clean out the keyboard with some
 isopropyl alcohol.  Since I had everything taken apart, and would have to wait weeks for the correct part to come, I tried cleaning it.  I really laid on the isopropyl alcohol
 (I got the highest % walgreens had).  I let the keyboard sit in a tub of it, and then tried brushing away some of the gunk with qtips.

I re-assembled the computer, but alas, the keyboard did not work.  However, it did not work in exactly the same way it was broken before, so I gained a lot of confidence in my ability to take apart the laptop and put it back together.  There were definitely some times in the middle there where I thought I had broken it.  At one point, I stripped a screw on the touch pad so bad that I ended up getting a power drill drilling the screw's head off.

I also learned about the retaining flap.  Taking the tabs out all along the way was easy without flipping up the tab, so I had no idea I was doing it wrong.  Then when putting it back together, I was cursing how hard it was.  That's when I finally watched a video of it and it showed the retaining flap.

I talked to PowerBookMedic support, and they were nice enough to let me return the wrong case and get a new one.  I just had to pay shipping and the price difference.  This should have been a warning sign to me, because there actually was no price difference in the 13" and 11" top cases.  Several weeks later, I got my new part, and was excited to put it all together when I found out that they had mistakenly sent me a 13" Mabcook Pro top case.  Luckily I checked this before disassembling everything again.  They again were very accomodating and rush delivered the correct part to me and refunded me the price difference they had charged me.  Their support was actually really great.

So I finally put it all together, and it worked!  The keys sound a little squeaky which is strange, but otherwise it works like a charm.  Now I want to take apart all my electronics!  Check out my next post about installing linux on this newly repaired laptop.
