In order to decide what kind of blog I wanted to make, I turned to some of my favorite blogs:

1. [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/)
1. [colah.github.io](http://colah.github.io)
1. [What If?](https://what-if.xkcd.com/)

They all share a common theme.
The author has learned something and creates a post to share
that knowledge.

In Wait But Why, Tim Urban describes his process [like this](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html):

> The way I approach a post like that is I’ll start with the surface of the topic and ask myself what I don’t fully get—I look for those foggy spots in the story where when someone mentions it or it comes up in an article I’m reading, my mind kind of glazes over with a combination of “ugh it’s that icky term again nah go away” and “ew the adults are saying that adult thing again and I’m seven so I don’t actually understand what they’re talking about.” Then I’ll get reading about those foggy spots—but as I clear away fog from the surface, I often find more fog underneath. So then I research that new fog, and again, often come across other fog even further down. My perfectionism kicks in and I end up refusing to stop going down the rabbit hole until I hit the floor.

I love reading his posts because he does two things.  First, he figures out what he doesn't get, even if it's something
that seems like everyone is supposed to know about.  Second, he digs and digs until he's gotten
to the basic principles at the "floor".  In reading his posts, I get to benefit
from all his hard work. Not only that, but his "tree trunk" method of explaining things
helps me to keep the knowledge in my head rather than immediately forgetting about it.

Christopher Olah has a similar approach.  In the introduction to his post on [information theory](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/), he says:
> Unfortunately, information theory can seem kind of intimidating. I don’t think there’s any reason it should be. In fact, many core ideas can be explained completely visually!

He proceeds to break down this seemingly daunting concept area in a way that can only
be done by someone who gets the concepts at a fundamental level. By the end of one of his posts, I feel
like I have a good foundation in the topic, and I have images in my head to refer back to.
Another thing that's great about his posts is that I know I can refer back to them.  For instance,
the concept of "mutual information" came up at work, and I knew immediately where I should
go for a refresher.

In ["What If?"](https://what-if.xkcd.com), Randall Munroe takes absurd hypothetical
question and answers them scientifically.  What I really like about these posts is
 that they illustrate that even the most ridiculous of questions can be broken down
 into pieces that fit into reality.  He always finds some footing to gain traction
 into the problem and explain it in terms of something more familiar.

What I like about all of these blogs is that they provide value to their readers
by distilling complicated topics into digestible chunks.  They get to the bottom
of a topic and then back up and bring it back together.  Their posts have little
to no pre-requisite knowledge.  Nothing is really a "given", and instead they
reason their way from the basic building blocks they find to their end result.

I want to take a similar approach to my blog.  I want to select a topic and
break it down to its first principles and build it back up to a full understanding.
I want to take no concept as granted. I want a reader to come away with a
few nuggets of information and the vocabulary that enables them to find out more
if they are interested.
