I read a lot of things on the internet.  I write a lot of stream of consciousness
in daily logs.  I work on side projects.  I want to write in order to organize
my thoughts, share checkpoints in my works in progress, and give back for all
the blog posts I have read that have helped me.

Blogs I like:

1. [Wait But Why](http://waitbutwhy.com/)
1. [colah.github.io](http://colah.github.io)
1. [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/)
1. [Joel On Software](http://joelonsoftware.com)



Things I like about them:

* Specific/Focused
  * They go deep on a particular topic until they bottom out or reach a resolution.
* Practical
  * Including code snippets and diagrams
* Thorough
  * Reading those posts gives you confidence in the subject matter because the author demonstrates
    that they have done their research in the area.  You feel that you are getting a distilled
    version of the information.  It feels as if you are saving yourself time by reading their version
    than trying to figure out your own.
* Consistent
 * I know what to expect when I find a new post on one of those blogs.

What do I want to get out of writing a blog?

* Practice communicating
* Crystallize thoughts
* Reference for myself to refer back to

What do I want to avoid?

Whenever I decide I want to tweet more, I start seeing the world through a lens
of snarky tweet sized tidbits.  I don't want to start seeing the world through a
lens of "This could make a great blog post!".  However, if blogging is going to
be a new hobby, and something I want to improve on, then thinking about it a lot
will be worthwhile.

How can I get to a place where I am publishing blog posts I am proud of?

* Lots of Practice
* Conquer fear of failure or embarrassment
* External feedback

There will be a balance between the need to practice with the need to maintain
the quality of the posts.  Does publishing partially completed posts mean that
I've conquered my fear of embarrassment? Or does it mean that I've compromised
on quality?  If I strive for perfection, will I ever post anything?

I could use some rules or guiding principles.  These can evolve as I learn
more about how to publish, but they should remain challenging.  The rules will
be a measuring stick for determining if I am staying true to my goals.  For starters,
I'll go with this:

1. One discrete improvement per week
  * Post, Revision, Infrastructure/Technology
1. One practical step a reader can take
1. One example of research in to the topic.
1. One diagram or code snippet


This week was getting the infrastructure set up, and making this post.  The practical
step for this week could be to checkout the posts I listed.  I still need to
do some research on how to blog and I should also include the snippet to get a
blog set up.
