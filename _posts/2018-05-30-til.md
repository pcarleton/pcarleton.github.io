title: "New Format: Today I Learned"
---

I am going to try a new format where I write about something I learned. Â My goals with this format are:

* Increase the amount of writing I do
* Increase the frequency of writing
* Lower the barrier for making a new post
* Document things I've learned

My rough goal is to spend:

* 20 minutes researching / outlining
* 20 minutes writing
* 20 minutes editting

We'll see how this time commitment works out, it may be a little extreme for daily writing. I'm going to try it for the next 3 days and then re-evaluate.
